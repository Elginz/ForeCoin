# IF THERE IS AN ERROR: Run the following after initiial installation of requirements

# pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall "feedparser>=6.0.10"

# EXPLANATION: It is logically impossible for pip to install a version of feedparser that is both greater than or equal to 6.0 and 
# less than 6.0 at the same time. This is why it fails with a ResolutionImpossible error.
